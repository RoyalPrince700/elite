## ðŸ“ž **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
- **Subscription Request Fails**: Check if plan IDs are correctly configured
- **Invoice Creation Error**: Verify admin has proper permissions and all required fields
- **Payment Status Not Updating**: Check user authentication and invoice status
- **Admin Cannot Confirm Payment**: Verify admin role and invoice exists
- **Plan Not Found Error**: Ensure subscription plans are seeded correctly

### **Debug Steps**
1. **Browser Console**: Check for API errors and response details
2. **User Authentication**: Verify JWT token and user permissions
3. **Admin Permissions**: Confirm user has `role: 'admin'`
4. **Database Documents**: Check MongoDB for correct document creation
5. **Server Logs**: Review backend logs for detailed error messages
6. **Network Tab**: Verify API requests and responses
7. **Plan IDs**: Ensure frontend plan IDs match database plan IDs
8. **Status Flow**: Check invoice and subscription request status progression
